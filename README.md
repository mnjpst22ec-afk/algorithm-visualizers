## Algorithm Visualizer

This project is an interactive Algorithm Visualizer that helps users understand and visualize the working of common algorithms in real-time. It is built using web technologies and supports visualizations for sorting and searching algorithms.
## Project Overview
Understanding algorithms can be challenging without visual representation. This project provides an interactive platform where users can:
- Observe how algorithms manipulate data step by step
- Understand time complexity and performance differences
- Experiment with custom input data
It is aimed at students, developers, and educators for learning purposes.

## Features
- Interactive visualization of algorithms
- Step-by-step execution with delay adjustment
- Highlighting comparisons, swaps, and traversals
- Supports multiple algorithm categories: Sorting, Searching, Graphs
- Responsive web interface

## Supported Algorithms
Sorting: Bubble Sort
Searching: Linear Search, Binary Search

 ## Technical Details
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Visualization: DOM manipulation with dynamic color coding
- Algorithm Logic: Pure JavaScript implementation
- Customizability: Users can extend with new algorithms by adding scripts to algorithms/
